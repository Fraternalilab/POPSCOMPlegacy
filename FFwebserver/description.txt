POPSCOMP is a method to analyse interactions between individual complex
components of proteins and/or nucleic acids by calculating the solvent
accessible surface area (SASA) buried upon complex formation.
It is based on POPS*, which calculates SASAs of individual proteins and
nucleic acid molecules at atomic (default) and residue (coarse-grained) level.
The underlying heuristic algorithm of POPS* uses a geometric approximation
to the shielding of atomic surface areas by nearest neighbour atoms.
